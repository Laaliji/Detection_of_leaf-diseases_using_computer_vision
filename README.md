# Early Detection of Leaf Diseases Using Image Processing and Computer Vision

This repository contains the code, report, and presentation materials for a university project conducted as part of the 2024/2025 academic year at **Université Cadi Ayyad, Faculté des Sciences et Techniques, Marrakech**, under the supervision of **Pr. Laila Amir**. The project focuses on the early detection of plant leaf diseases using image processing and computer vision techniques, with the aim of reducing reliance on harmful phytosanitary products in agriculture.

## Project Overview

### Objectives
- Apply image processing and computer vision algorithms to detect plant leaf diseases at an early stage.
- Develop a practical application to analyze leaf images and classify them as healthy or diseased.
- Provide a solution to agronomic challenges by minimizing environmental impact and improving agricultural productivity.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python 
- **Libraries**:
  - OpenCV: For image processing and computer vision tasks.
  - Scikit-image: For advanced image segmentation.
  - NumPy: For numerical operations.
  - Matplotlib: For visualizing results.
  - (Optional) Scikit-learn: For basic machine learning classification.
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm, or any Python IDE.
- **Operating System**: Compatible with Windows, Linux, or macOS.

## Dataset
The project uses the **PlantVillage Dataset**, a publicly available collection of over 54,000 images of healthy and diseased leaves from 14 plant species, covering 26 disease types.  
- **Source**: [PlantVillage-Dataset on GitHub](https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset)  
- **Format**: RGB images organized into folders by class (healthy or diseased).

Alternatively, custom datasets can be created by photographing leaves and manually annotating them.
